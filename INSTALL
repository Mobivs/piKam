Prerequisites

  On RaspberryPi - assuming Raspbian
     Install the python-twisted package (used for client/server networking).
     Kivy is not yet available for Raspbian, so you will have to use a 
     remote Kivy client...

  On the selected Kivy client platform install kivy, for example:

     On GUI client Linux machine:
     Install Kivy - most distributions seem to have a kivy package available. 
     On OpenSUSE this seemed to install everything needed including Twisted.

     On client Android machine:
     Install the "Kivy Launcher" app from the Play Store.

Installation/Test

1)  Copy piKamServer.py to your RaspberryPi
    Start the server, at the shell prompt:  

         python piKamServer.py

2a) Linux client: 
    Create a folder called piKam (or anything you prefer).
    Copy all the piKam files to this folder. 
    In a shell, cd to the piKam folder and enter: 

         python piKam.py

    A GUI should fire up.
    Press F1 to bring up the piKam settings dialog. 
    Set the address of you RaspberryPi.
    Close settings.
    See if you can connect and "Capture" a photo.
    
2b) Android client: 
    Find where "Kivy Launcher" put it's apps folder.
    Lets say you find that Kivy Launcher is using /sdcard0/kivy/
    Create a sub-folder /sdcard0/kivy/pikam 
    Copy all the piKam files into this folder (skip piKamServer if you wish).
    Start the Kivy Launcher, it should list a piKam app, tap on it.
    A GUI should fire up.
    Tap the standard Android settings button/icon to bring up the piKam settings dialog. 
    Set the address of you RaspberryPi.
    Close settings.
    See if you can connect and take a photo.

3b) Other clients - probably similar to Linux


Controls:
    Mostly obvious.
    Swipe left right on the image to goto prev/next.    
    Photos are written to the client install folder.
