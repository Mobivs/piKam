Prerequisites

  On RaspberryPi - assuming Raspbian
     Install the python-twisted package (used for client server networking)
     Kivy is not yet available for Raspbian, so you will have to use a 
     remote Kivy client...

  On the selected Kivy client platform install kivy, for example:

     On GUI client Linux machine:
     Install Kivy - most distributions seem to have a kivy package available. 
     On OpenSUSE this seemed to install everything needed including Twisted

     On client Android machine:
     Install the Kivy Launcher app from the Play Store.

Installation

1) Copy piKamServer.py to your RaspberryPi

2a) Linux client: copy everthing to a folder on the client.

2b) Android client: find where kivy put it's apps folder - e.g. /sdcard0/kivy/,
    create a folder /sdcard0/kivy/pikam 
    copy everything into this folder (skip piKamServer if you wish)

3b) Other clients - probably similar to Linux

Test

1) On you RaspberryPi start the server, at the shell prompt:  python piKamServer.py

2a) On Linux, in a shell, cd to the pikam folder and enter: python piKam.py
    A gui should fire up - press F1 and set the address of you RaspberryPi
    See if you can connect and take a photo.

2b) On Android, start the Kivy Launcher and pick piKam.
    A gui should fire up - press the settings key and set the address of you RaspberryPi
    See if you can connect and take a photo.

    Mostly obvious.
