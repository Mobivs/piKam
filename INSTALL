Prerequisites

  On RaspberryPi - assuming Raspbian
     Install the python-twisted package (used for client/server networking).
     Kivy is not yet available for Raspbian, so you will have to use a 
     remote Kivy client...

  On the selected Kivy client platform install kivy, for example:

     On GUI client Linux machine:
     Install Kivy - most distributions seem to have a kivy package available. 
     On OpenSUSE this seemed to install everything needed including Twisted.

     On client Android machine:
     Install the "Kivy Launcher" app from the Play Store.
     
  Optional picam module for direct python camera access:
     The server normally uses the raspistill command to drive the 
     camera.  I've included an alternate server that directly accesses
     the camera via Sean Ashton's picam module.  If you wish to use 
     the picam module then follow Sean's installation instructions at 
  
       https://github.com/ashtons/picam/blob/master/README.md

     Plus picam requires the python image library, which can be
     installed by running the following command:
  
       sudo apt-get install python-imaging-tk

Installation/Test

1)  Copy piKamServer.py to your Raspberry Pi
    Start the server, at the shell prompt:  

         python piKamServer.py
         
    
    OR - if you wish to use the picam python module for direct
    camera access, then also copy piKamPicamServer.py
    to your Raspberry Pi and run that instead:
     
         python piKamPicamServer.py

2a) Linux client: 
    Create a folder called piKam (or anything you prefer).
    Copy all the piKam files to this folder. 
    In a shell, cd to the piKam folder and enter: 

         python piKam.py

    A GUI should fire up.
    Press F1 to bring up the piKam settings dialog. 
    Set the address of you RaspberryPi.
    Close settings.
    See if you can connect and "Capture" a photo.
    
2b) Android client: 
    Find where "Kivy Launcher" put it's apps folder.
    Lets say you find that Kivy Launcher is using /sdcard0/kivy/
    Create a sub-folder /sdcard0/kivy/pikam 
    Copy all the piKam files into this folder (skip piKamServer if you wish).
    Start the Kivy Launcher, it should list a piKam app, tap on it.
    A GUI should fire up.
    Tap the standard Android settings button/icon to bring up the piKam settings dialog. 
    Set the address of you RaspberryPi.
    Close settings.
    See if you can connect and take a photo.

3b) Other clients - probably similar to Linux


Controls:
    Mostly obvious.
    Swipe left right on the image to goto prev/next.    
    Photos are written to the client install folder.
